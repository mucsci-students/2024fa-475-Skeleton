1ST PISS CALL
Colonel
(Static crackles, then the Colonel’s voice comes through, filled with urgency)

    "This is the Colonel. You’ve successfully activated your Personal Intercommunications Speaking System Emergency Radio. Or, as we call it around here, your P.I.S.S.E.R. Listen here, son. We don’t have much time."

Player
(Voice breaking through with a casual tone)

    "Kept you waiting, huh?"

Colonel

    "I’m glad you’re alive, at least. Listen, you need to find a way out of there—there must be an exit somewhere nearby. An agent will contact you via P.I.S.S stream once we've figured out your next steps. Stay alive. Over and out."


END TRANSMISSION



2ND PISS CALL

Leah
(Leah is soft but panicked, as though constantly checking over her shoulder)

    "Hey, it’s Leah. One of the lab techs... you know, the good ones. The Colonel filled me in on your little escape plan. Or should I say, ‘our’ escape plan?"

Player
(Slightly confused, then suspicious)

    "Who... who are you? Are you here to turn me in?"

Leah
(Defensive, then hesistant)

    "No, no, not at all. I’m helping you. The Colonel’s counting on you to get us all out. I’m just... a bit more stuck here than you are. I don’t have a choice."

Player

    "Why would you help me then? The things they're saying I did..."

Leah

    "I get it. The whole situation’s messed up. But you’re our best shot. There's a keycard somewhere in the lab. It'll get you level 1 access so you can move into the sewer system."

Player

    "So, the keycard is in the middle of the heavily guarded lab? Yeah, this doesn’t sound like a setup at all."

Leah
(Voice getting quieter)

    "I’ve got my own problems. (hushed) Someone's coming: I’ll check in later. Stay safe, and don’t screw this up."

END TRANSMISSION








3RD PISS CALL

(Static and clicking noises; the Colonel’s voice is different)

    "Ah, so you made it to the sewers. A bit... stinky, don’t you think? But I suppose we work with what we have. I’m just glad you escaped the lab—those guys were, frankly, idiots. I would've killed you if you had died to them."


Player
Ayo?-

(Interrupted with sounds of papers shuffling)
    "A Lv 2 keycard. In the sewers. You’ll find it—somewhere.  Then the correct door will take you to outside and you'll be one step closer to freedom. Just don't use it on the wrong door."

Player
(Suddenly cautious)
What happens if I use it on the wrong door?


(Voice begins glitching)

    "Mess around and find out, rookie."
    (Click, transmission cuts)

END TRANSMISSION




4TH PISS CALL
Player
(Slightly exasperated, speaking quickly)

    "Leah! I made it out of the sewers. Finally. How many more of these keycards do I need? They're like Pokémon cards at this point."

Leah
(Sounds like she’s flipping through something)

    "Oh, I hear you. Now, listen carefully. There’s a bunch of trucks out there. You’re gonna need to find the key to one of them. I think I heard a guard say they're kept in the office, but that's a level 3 clearance room."

Player
(Frustrated, then laughing)

    "Wait, seriously? You’re telling me I need a key for my key now? Jesus-"

Leah
(Sighs, then chuckles)

    "You wanna get out of here or not? You're just lucky they aren't under better watch. I’m sure you can find a keycard laying around near one of the trucks. Just don't let them see you."

Player
(Deadpan)

    "Yeah. Just avoid all of the highly trained soldiers actively trying to kill me. Easy."

Leah
(Laughing lightly)

    "I'm sure you'll find a way. Good luck!"
